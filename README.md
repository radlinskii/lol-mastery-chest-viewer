<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**LoL Mastery Chest Viewer** helps you quickly check which of your champions still have *Mastery Chests* available in this season of *League of Legends*.
It can become handy if you are already in the *Champion Select* menu and you are not sure on which champions you have already been granted the *Mastery Chest*.
It uses the data directly from official [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com).

> Currently, **LoL Mastery Chest Viewer** supports only the *EUNE* servers.

### Built With

* [Go](https://golang.org)
* [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com)

### Deployed To

* [Heroku](https://heroku.com) at [lol-mastery-chest-viewer.herokuapp.com](https://lol-mastery-chest-viewer.herokuapp.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Golang**  v1.13+ - see [official installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. **Node** v12+ - see [installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/radlinskii/lol-mastery-chest-viewer.git
    ```

2. Create `.env` file in the repository root folder and specify there following environment variables:
    ```dotenv
    RIOT_API_TOKEN=YOUR_RIOT_GAMES_API_TOKEN # get one at https://developer.riotgames.com
    PORT=1010 # Port for your API server
    ENV=development # environment, server is configured to accept CORS requests only in "development" environment
    ```

3. Create another `.env` file in the `/client` folder with:
    ```dotenv
    REACT_APP_API_URL='http://localhost:1010' # url to local API instance, this is used to benefit from CRA's hot-reload feature
    ```

4. Run the server
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

5. Run client
    ```sh
    cd client
    npm install
    npm run start
    ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

On the web app you can search for data of any summoner from the EUNE servers.

![screenshot](docs/images/screenshot1.png)

But if you are in *Champion Select* menu you probably don't have time for that, so you can simply add a url with your *summoner* name as a search parameter to your browser. When you visit the site the `summonerName` is used preload the content, so there will be no need for additional typing.

Go and check: <https://lol-mastery-chest-viewer.herokuapp.com/?summonerName=Lacertael>
